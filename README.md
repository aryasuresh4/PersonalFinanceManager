**Personal Finance Manager â€“ MERN Stack Expense Tracker**

Personal Finance Manager is a web-based application designed to help users track their income and expenses efficiently. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), it ensures a seamless user experience with JWT-based authentication, session persistence, and intuitive financial management.
Users can add, view, and manage transactions, track income and expenses, and view a transaction history that remains saved even after a page refresh. The dashboard provides a financial summary with real-time updates, while charts visually represent spending patterns.
The backend handles secure API requests and stores transactions in MongoDB. With session persistence, users stay logged in until they manually log out.
This project aims to provide a secure, user-friendly way to manage personal finances, helping users analyze spending habits and improve budgeting effortlessly.
